# Cab_Transportation_Network

This Computer networks project is implemented based on the networking topics like socket programming, networking protocols and packet tracing.

# Problem Statement

Nowadays cabs are a major part of metropolitan transport system,where people find a balance between comfort and reliability. It is not easy for person to find a taxi stand physically present everywhere he goes. An online application that helps a person to book a cab, pick him up from his location and drop him at his destination will be of a great use in todayâ€™s world. With the help of proper networking ,we can build an usable application that satisfies these needs.

# Tools Used
 
 1. Pycharm             
 2. Cisco Packet Tracer 

# Project Roadmap

1. Socket Programming

 * Create a Client-Server System.
 * Create a Client-Server System using Go Back N.
 * Create a Client-Server System using Select Repeat.
 * Carry out certain system-related operations.
 * Fill out an excel page with the information.

2. Packet Tracing

 * Subnet the IP address block you've chosen.
 * Calculate the Variable Length Subnet Mask
 * Assign IP subnets to the system's sub-divisions.
 * Use the RIP routing protocol.
 * Carry out the VLAN protocol.

# Conclusion
Our objective to be able to book a cab with regards to their departure and destination places using socket programming, Vlan , rip routing also to create a track record of all the fare details and also to show the structure of the network .Incase the message has failed to reach from server to client, the message will be re-transmitted via Selective Repeat & GoBackN. And the model has been implemented in Cisco Packet Tracer.
